# Polygenic_Background_Rare_Variant_Axis

Studies of the genetic basis of complex traits have demonstrated a substantial role for common, small-effect variant polygenic burden (cSEV-PB) as well as large-effect variants (LEV, primarily rare). Here, we developed an approach to leverage the relationship between the two sources of genetic risk among individuals who share a diagnosis to gain insights into genetic architectures and models of disease liability. Using simulations of diverse genetic architectures under several generative models of disease liability, we investigated the power to detect a difference in cSEV-PB among cases between carriers and non-carriers of the large-effect variants, while varying sample size, disease prevalence, common-SNP-based heritability, the trait variance explained by the putative large-effect variants, and the proportion of non-causal variants. Our results uncover a range of possibilities for when the risk derived from the cSEV-PB is comparable to the LEV-derived risk and underscore the diverse ways cSEV-PB may modify rare variant penetrance.  We applied our methodology to multiple phenotypes including Tourette Syndrome (TS), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and type 1 diabetes (T1D). We detected significantly lower cSEV-PB among cases with putative large-effect variants (either rare or common) in TS and T1D. These findings have implications for clinical use of polygenic risk scores and may prove broadly useful for the design of future genetic studies across the human disease phenome.
